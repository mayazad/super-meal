## ✨ Features

### 👤 Member Management
- Add / deactivate members

### 🍛 Daily Meals Ledger
- Log regular and guest meals per member per day with `+` / `−` controls
- **Monthly History table** — filtered by selected month, auto-refreshed via Supabase Realtime

### ⚡ Utility Payment Matrix

- Grid view: toggle each member's payment status (Paid / Pending) per bill
- Optimistic UI updates with automatic rollback on error

### 💰 Deposits
- Log meal fund deposits and utility deposits separately per member

### 📊 Public Summary Page (`/summary/YYYY-MM`)
- **Shareable URL** — roommates view their own balances without logging in
- **Month navigation** — ‹ / › arrows to browse any past month

- **Status badges** — `✓ In Credit` / `Needs to Pay` / `✓ Settled` per card

  - `Meals` — day-wise meal ledger

  - `Summary` — final per-member balance sheet
- **My Statement** — per-member `.xlsx` download filtered to their own data

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or later → [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A **Supabase** project → [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayazad/super-meal.git
cd super-meal
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> This installs Next.js, React, Tailwind, Supabase client, Framer Motion, xlsx, html-to-image, lucide-react, and all other packages listed in `package.json`. `node_modules` is **not** committed to the repo — this step is required before running.

### 4. Set up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to **SQL Editor** and run the full contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql) to create all tables and RLS policies
3. Go to **Project Settings → API** and copy your:
   - Project URL
   - `anon` public key

### 5. Configure environment variables

The `.env.local` file is included in this repo (private). If setting up fresh:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 6. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 7. Admin access

- Navigate to `/admin/login`
- Sign in with the email/password you set up in Supabase Auth (Authentication → Users)
